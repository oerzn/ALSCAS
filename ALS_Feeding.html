    <h1 class="text-primary  text-center py-4">Swallowing Issues/Feeding Tube</h1>

    <p>In Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), as disease progress swallowing muscle weakness, This condition is called <strong>dysphagia</strong>. It can lead to difficulty in eating, drinking, and even managing saliva, impacting both nutrition and respiratory health.</p>
    <div>
    <h3 class="py-3">Identifying Swallowing Difficulties</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Choking or coughing while eating or drinking</li>
      <li>Food or liquid escaping from the nose</li>
      <li>Frequent throat clearing</li>
      <li>Drooling or pooling of saliva</li>
      <li>Unintentional weight loss or dehydration</li>
      <li>Changes in voice quality (e.g., wet or gurgly voice after eating)</li>
    </ol>
    </div>
    <h2 class="py-3">Methods to Improve Swallowing</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Work with a speech-language pathologist (SLP) for swallowing therapy</li>
      <li>Use of thickened liquids to prevent aspiration</li>
      <li>Modify food texture (soft, pureed, or blended foods)</li>
      <li>Adopt safe swallowing techniques such as chin-tuck or head-turn strategies</li>
      <li>Eat slowly and in an upright position</li>
      <li>Maintain good oral hygiene to reduce risk of infection</li>
      <li>Use Feeding Tube(PEG, RT) for proper nutrition, and weight management.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="py-3">Feeding Tubes</h2>
    <p>When oral feeding becomes unsafe or insufficient, a feeding tube may be recommended. This helps ensure proper nutrition and hydration without the risk of aspiration.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>PEG (Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy) Tube:</strong> Inserted directly into the stomach through the abdominal wall. Used for long-term feeding.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Nasogastric Tube (NGT)/Ryles tube:</strong> A Tube inserted through the nose into the stomach. Non invasive method, need to change it frequently.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Deciding on feeding tube placement is a personal and medical choice, ideally made early while the patient can participate in decision-making.</p>
    <h2 class="py-3">PEG Tube: Insertion, Care, and Maintenance</h2>
    <p><strong>Insertion Procedure:</strong> A PEG tube is placed through the abdominal wall into the stomach using an endoscope. It’s usually done under sedation and takes about 30-45 minutes.</p>
    <p><strong> Procedure Done by:</strong> Gastroenterologists</p>
    <p><strong>Care Instructions:</strong></p>
    <p>Check the <a href="">PEG dressing page</a></p>
    <p><strong>Type of PEG Tube:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Changing the PEG Tube:</strong> The tube typically needs replacement every 6 to 12 months, depending on the type and condition of the tube. This is usually done by a healthcare provider.</p>

    <h2 class="py-3">Nasogastric Tube (NGT)/Ryles Tube: Insertion, Use, and Maintenance</h2>
    <p><strong>Insertion Procedure:</strong> A Ryles tube is a thin(FG16), flexible tube inserted through the nostril, down the esophagus, and into the stomach. This is typically done by a nurse or trained healthcare provider and can be performed at the bedside.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Care Instructions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure the tube remains secured with tape at the nose to avoid displacement.</li>
      <li>Check for correct placement regularly, especially before feeding or giving medications.</li>
      <li>Flush the tube with water before and after each use to prevent blockage.</li>
      <li>Keep the nostril and surrounding skin clean and dry to prevent irritation.</li>
      <li><p>Check the <a href="">Ryles tube document</a></p></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Changing the NGT:</strong> NGTs are generally replaced every 10-14 days or as directed by the healthcare provider to minimize the risk of infection or tube damage.</p>

      <div class="accordion-body">
        ALS affects the nerves that control muscles, including those used for swallowing. As the disease progresses, these muscles weaken, making it difficult and sometimes unsafe to swallow food or liquids.

      <div class="accordion-body">
        A feeding tube is typically recommended when patients have significant weight loss, choking risks, or long meal times. It helps maintain nutrition and hydration even when swallowing becomes too difficult or unsafe.

      <div class="accordion-body">
        Not necessarily. Many ALS patients continue to eat small amounts by mouth for pleasure, if it's safe to do so. The feeding tube is mainly used to ensure adequate nutrition and reduce the stress of eating full meals.
