                    <p class="py-2">
                        We’re sharing our daily home care routine for managing a bedridden patient, hoping it serves as a helpful reference for caregivers and families.
                        This routine outlines our time-based schedule, including each activity/procedure with brief steps. While some details may be hard to grasp without visuals,
                        we plan to share videos soon for better understanding.
                    </p>
                    
                      <p class="py-2">
                        <b style="color:tomato;">Please note:</b> We are sharing details of what we considered were the best for Mumma from our experience and knowledge we researched from medical procedures/internet information available .. and there are many  improvisation and new procedures we added ourselves from the day one to the stage what we reached here today.
                      </p>
                    
                      <p class="py-2">
                        If the patient uses a urinal catheter, tasks related to bedpan and diaper changes will be fewer. Similarly, using an HME filter instead of a humidifier
                        reduces the need for 3-hourly water refills and weekly chamber cleaning. We don’t use a urinal catheter or HME filter, as these caused discomfort for Mumma.
                      </p>
                    
                      <p class="py-2">
                        Also, apart from daily care, many procedures need to be done weekly, monthly, or quarterly. These should be integrated into the daily routine as needed.
                      </p>

                      <p >As there are procedures and monitoring which need to be active throughout 24*7... we cannot say when we start our day. However as per anybody regular routine, we are starting time schedule 7 AM. Activities which are repeated, their frequency values are highlighted with blue color. <span style="color: tomato;"> Most important and urgent procedure is highlighted in red i.e. trachea suction.</span></p>

        <br>We keep upper half towel(dipped in bucket)  and lower sponge towel (Mug) separate. Start at one side(right) which suits you. Take out the shirt on that side and let it remain below arm to avoid weting of bedsheet. If you have helper –let her start at legs but on opposite direction to avoid interruptions. Take squeezed towel each time and clean in small portion –first time with only arms & fingers rubbing atleast twice every section , second squeeze with front half of that side + under arms. Dry each time with clean dry towel.  Go to other side(left). Let helper hold and lift patient slightly above so you can pull out shirt from below. Follow same procedure this side.
        <br>Let wear one side shirt in left side arm and front. Layered it on top and keep front portion in covered and hold with right arm to support PEG tube while side –turn. Pull and curve legs in V- shape for turning. Always do oral suction thoroughly before side turn to avoid any coughing. Let helper turn body (keep cushion on curve portion below legs to support) and give her support to hold of Vent tube carefully so it doesn’t shake and avoid patient coughing. Keep dry towel on bed sheet and start cleaning with wet towel on left side back and left hip. Clean and dry that side. Take the layered shirt and place it below so as to pull from right side turn. Come on right side, keep legs in same position and let helper turn body on other side so as to clean right side back.

Hold upwards each side of leg by each person and quickly place diaper beneath. Turn over mom lower back from each side to clear any diaper foldings which may hurt body. Close diaper very loosely so it should not leave marks on mom's body.  Take 3 ft/2ft poly sheet and similar size double or thick cotton cloth.Using same procedure, place below the diaper.  Hold bedsheet from below legs, pull it while holding legs upwards to clean any bedsheet foldings. Hold mom's shirt corner from each side , Pull it to make it straight (so folding of shirt clothing should not keep hurting body) One person to hold Mom neck with complete support from shoulder and other should pull pillow to give complete neck support. Hold bedsheet from sides of hips and around neck, pull it above with force so mom also moves upwards to place her in  proper position on bed.This will take bedsheet upwards and after few times of such setting new bedsheet required to be placed on feet side which move upwards and bedsheet gets changed automatically.</p></p>

        <p style=" color: rgb(117, 92, 92);">Procedure ---> <p class="py-2 ">We use Portex cuffed tracheostomy tube. Its recommended practice to do once/day cuff deflate/inflate.(also cuff needs to be monitored 5-10 times during day to check whether ventilator leak reading is coming proper and cuff is inflated properly(For single limb ventilator circuit 22-28  leak values are OK). If leak is over 30-inflat the cuff by 0.2 ml and wait for 5 mins and observe Vent readings. Need to repeat in case more inflation required.) Perform this procedure when mom is in comfortable & calm stage for 5 mins or so. Switch on TV as this will divert mind towards TV and procedure can be performed with less difficulty or coughing. Take 5ml syringe, remove needle, attach to cuff, slightly press and turn so it will come attach as  lock with cuff. Now very very slowly take out air from cuff by pulling the syringe handle.Take out syringe in between and do careful oral suction in between - this can lead to lot of coughing, monitor whether to extract more air from cuff or fill back again.Generally cuff air will be around 7-10ml depending on difference between trache opening size and tracheal wall. It should be filled to that pressure so holding a cuff balloon  should be slightly soft between thumb & first finger(do not apply pressure).
