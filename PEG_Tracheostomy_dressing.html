    <p>
        ALS Patient with Tracheostomy Tube and PEG Feeding tube required timily dressing. In ALS patients, maintaining proper hygiene and regular dressing of both the tracheostomy tube and PEG (Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy) tube sites is critical for preventing infections and ensuring comfort. The skin around these sites can be vulnerable due to immobility and reduced immunity. Timely dressing changes—typically once a day , dry, and free from irritation. For the tracheostomy, clean dressing also prevents buildup of secretions and allows for easier breathing. Around the PEG site, regular dressing reduces the risk of leakage and skin breakdown. Proper care not only improves quality of life but also minimizes hospital visits due to preventable complications.

    <h5 class="py-2 text-center bg-info ">Procedure</h5>
    <ol>
        <li> Wash your Hands with antiseptic soap and let it dry on its own before cutting the gauge for dressing.</li>
        <li>Open the gauge in full length and then cut 10 x 10 sterile gauge in half from the middle till 4 plies and fold it to make a long ¾ inches long dressing. (Ref fig. 1). Make sure to keep the open thread side inside the fold to avoid any stuck of thread in the trachea stoma.</li>
        <li>Make small pieces of folded gauge properly covering the open threads for cleaning the stoma area. As there is very little space under the tracheostomy tube to actually clean it with your finger so you can better use a toothpick and fix a cleaning gauge piece on the broader side to clean.</li>
        <li> Dip the cleaning gauge piece in Betadine solution and then clean the stoma area from all the sides.        </li>
        <li>Once the cleaning is done apply small amount of Hydrocortisone/cutiisoft on the tip of fresh gauge piece (again can be fixed on toothpick) and apply on all the sides of stoma.</li>
        <li> Further, dip the dressing gauge that we’ve already prepared earlier, in betadine solution from centre which will cover the stoma and save it from any infections.</li>
        <li>Firstly, place the center portion of dressing gauge under the stoma, then insert gauge side from both the sides and take it out from the opposite sides to form a full circle. Make sure to keep the circle in comfortable position, i.e. Neither loose nor tight.</li>
        
    </ol>
    <h5 class="py-2 text-center bg-info ">Dressing When trachostomy Tube change</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Use dressing application of Hydrocortisone/ cutisoft tube before and after the tube change. And try to maintain this for next 2-3 times.</li>
        <li>For eg. If, Tube is supposed to be changed on 10th of the month, make sure do the hydrocortisone dressing on 7th, 9th, and 10th (before 3-4 hrs of tube change) and on 11th, 13th & 15th.
        </li>
        <li>This will avoid the formation of granulation in and around the stoma.</li>
    </ol>
    <h5 class="py-2 text-center bg-info ">   If any bleeding occurs in stoma</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>If it bleeds during the cleaning/ dressing of stoma, do not apply hydrocortisone and only use betadine solution on the dressing gauge around the stoma area.</li>
       
    </ol>

    <h5 class="py-2 text-center bg-info ">Procedure</h5>
    <ol>
        <li> Wash your Hands with antiseptic soap and let it dry on its own before cutting the gauge for dressing.</li>
        <li>Open the gauge in full length and then cut 10 x 10 sterile gauge in half from the middle till 4 plies and first fold its width, then its length to half and then cut in two equal pieces. And give 3 slits to give it flower like shape once applied for dressing. (Make sure to keep the open thread side inside the fold to avoid any stuck of thread in.)</li>
        <li>Make small pieces of folded gauge properly covering the open threads for cleaning the stoma area. As there is very little space under the tracheostomy tube to actually clean it with your finger so you can better use a toothpick and fix a cleaning gauge piece on the broader side to clean.</li>
        <li> Dip the cleaning gauge piece in Betadine solution and then clean the stoma area from all the sides.        </li>
        <li>Once the cleaning is done apply small amount of Hydrocortisone/ cutisoft / Soframycin on the tip of fresh gauge piece (again can be fixed on toothpick) and apply on all the sides of stoma.</li>
        <li>Place both the earlier cut gauge pieces to form a flower like shape around the stoma as shown in the fig. Make sure to keep the circle in comfortable position, i.e. Neither loose nor tight.
        </li>
        <li>Stick the dressing with 2 micropore tape strips fixing the gauge and peg disc to move.</li>
        
    </ol>
    <h5 class="py-2 text-center bg-info ">Types of dressing application</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Dressing is done on alternative basis and with <strong>alternative</strong> solutions such as Betadine/ Soframycin/ Hydrocortisone depending on the condition.</li>
        <li>If it remains clear after regular cleaning of dry flakes of feed juices with sterile gauge, the dressing can be done without any application of any of the solution mentioned above.
        </li>
        <li>If you see a granulation around the stoma you should apply hydrocortisone more often.</li>
        <li>If it bleeds during the cleaning/ dressing of stoma, do not apply hydrocortisone and only use betadine solution on the dressing gauge around the stoma area.</li>
        <li>If you observe any hardness of skin around the Stoma, Soframycin can be applied.</li>
    </ol>
