                            <li>Consult at least 3-4 neurologists to confirm the diagnosis and rule out mimic diseases. In addition to recommended tests, consider checking CPK Total, Acetylcholine receptor, MUSK antibody/antigen levels, ANA profile, CACNA, PACNA levels for assessing autoimmune condition with probable IgIV treatment available. Also, get genetic testing done to understand any specific gene mutation impact in case of familial form of ALS.
                            <li> An ALS support group </li>
                            <li>Maintain a positive environment at home, and plan some get togethers to keep spirits high.</li>
                            <li>Nutrition is extremely important, please focus on the diet. Include good protein supplements like Ensure, whey protein etc in your diet. Get tested for Vit D and Vit B12 levels and keep them in upper range of sufficient category. Adding ashwagandha and Vit C in daily routine may be helpful.</li>
                                Engage in light exercise to remain active. Avoid strenuous physiotherapy or hard massage. Instead, gentle oil application is Ok .</li>

                            <li>Consider voice banking early when speech issues arise. This can help regenerate PALS’s own voice later using PALS’s own, using technology tools when speech deteriorates.</li>

<p class="px-4 py-3">ALS affects the body, not the mind. One can live a long, fulfilling life with proper management of nutrition, and breathing by taking PEG & BiPAP/ventilator decisions at the right time. By using appropriate communication tools, one can also continue to live a well-connected social and professional life for years, even while being on PEG and Ventilator.
